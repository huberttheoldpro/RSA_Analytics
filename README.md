This prototype Python tool is designed for academic research into RSA cryptographic vulnerabilities. It operates exclusively on RSA keys that it generates internally and is intended solely for controlled experimentation and educational analysis.
This code is designed for Linux and will not work on Windows without the /root directory.
The code is not intended, nor should it be used, for unauthorized attempts to break or compromise real-world RSA implementations.
Modification for such purposes is strictly discouraged.
